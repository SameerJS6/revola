### Components API
Description of props for each component.

#### Root
Contains all the parts of a Revola.

<TypeTable
  type={{
    defaultOpen: {
      description: 'The open state of the Revola when it is initially rendered. Use when you do not need to control its open state.',
      type: 'boolean',
      default: 'false'
    },
    open: {
      description: 'The controlled open state of the Revola',
      type: 'boolean',
      default: 'false'
    },
    onOpenChange: {
      description: 'Event handler called when the open state of the drawer changes.',
      type: 'function',
      typeDescription: '(open: boolean) => void',
      default: '',
    },
    modal: {
      description: 'The modality of the dialog. When set to `true`, interaction with the outside elements will be disabled and only dialog content will be visible to screen readers.',
      type: 'boolean',
      default: 'true'
    },
    direction: {
      description: 'Direction of the drawer on mobile. This adjust the animations and the drag direction.',
      type: 'directionType',
      typeDescription: '"top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right"',
      default: 'bottom'
    },
    dismissible: {
      description: "When `false` dragging, clicking outside, pressing `Esc`, etc. will not close the drawer. Use this in combination with the open prop, otherwise you won't be able to open/close the Revola.",
      type: 'boolean',
      default: 'true'
    },
    repositionInputs: {
      description: "When `true` Vaul will reposition inputs rather than scroll then into view if the keyboard is in the way. Setting it to `false`will fall back to browser's default behaviour.",
      type: 'boolean',
      default: 'true'
    }
  }}
/>

{/* Additional props for snap points (This props only apply to drawer on mobile): */}
These props only apply when Revola is rendered as a drawer on mobile.

<TypeTable type={{
  snapPoints: {
    description: "Array of numbers from 0 to 1 that corresponds to % of the screen a given snap point should take up. You can also use px values, which doesn't take screen height into account.",
    type: 'array',
    typeDescription: 'Array<number | string>',
    default: ''
  },
  activeSnapPoint: {
    description: "The controlled snap point state",
    type: 'boolean'
  },
  setActiveSnapPoint: {
    description: "Event handler called when the snap point state changes.",
    type: 'function',
    typeDescription: "(open: boolean) => void",
  },
  fadeFromIndex: {
    description: "Index of snapPoint from which the overlay fade should be applied. Defaults to the last step of snapPoints",
    type: 'number',
    default: 'snapPoints.length'
  },
  snapSequentialPoint: {
    description: "Disabled velocity based swiping for snap points. This means that a snap point won't be skipped even if the velocity is high enough. Useful if each snap point in a drawer is equally important.",
    type: 'boolean',
    default: 'false'
  }
}}/>

Revola provides additional props to control its behavior across devices. 
<TypeTable type={{

      type: 'boolean',
      default: "false",
    },
    "onlyDialog?": {
      description:
