## The Problem: Why I Built *Native Modal*

You might ask: why create a **drawer component for mobile** when a **modal/dialog** already exists?    
The answer stems from my experience during a project approximately **8-9 months ago**.

### The Personal Experience

About 8-9 months ago, I was involved in a website migration project, specifically moving a company's WordPress-based website to **Next.js with Builder.io**. As the project neared completion, a critical UI issue emerged:

#### The "Buy Modal" UX Problem

The website featured a **Buy Modal**â€”a **dialog component** embedding a **third-party widget via an `iframe`**. This widget displayed:

* **Product details**
* **A pharmacy search tab**
* **A list of pharmacies selling the product**

#### The Issues?

* It functioned adequately on desktop but presented a poor user experience on mobile.
* The modal felt cramped, clunky, and difficult to interact with.
* It wasted vertical space, leading to frustrating navigation.
* The overall experience felt unnatural and broken.

While I wasn't directly responsible for this component, the experience was a key motivator. I recognized the potential for a better solution.

### How This Led to Native Modal

Few months later, I had the opportunity to address this issue in a different project (Vulniphan).

My objectives were:

1.  **Resolve the inadequate modal experience on mobile** by implementing a drawer component.
2.  **Maintain API simplicity**, similar to `@radix-ui/react-dialog` and `vaul` drawers.
3.  **Ensure seamless integration for developers**, enabling automatic adaptation between modal (desktop) and drawer (mobile) without requiring additional code.

This led to the development of the first version of **Native Modal**â€”a component designed to automatically adapt between a drawer on mobile and a modal on desktop.

## The UX Perspective: Why Drawers Are Preferred on Mobile

The fundamental issue with modals on mobile is their disruption of context (they mess with the flow).

Native mobile UIs (iOS & Android) predominantly utilize drawers, bottom sheets, or full-page transitions instead of modals for specific content types.

A drawer often stands out as the superior choice because:

### 1. Mobile OS Standards Favor Drawers

* **Apple's iOS** employs sheets (bottom drawers) for navigation and secondary tasks.
* **Google's Material Design** advocates for bottom sheets for actions and progressive disclosure.

>   'Use a non-modal view when presenting supplementary items that affect the main task in the parent view.' â€” Apple HIG

---

### 2. Drawers Maximize Screen Space

Modals/dialogs on mobile often have fixed dimensions and limited space.

* A drawer (bottom sheet) utilizes the full width of the screen and expands vertically, providing increased space for content.
* This proves advantageous for content-heavy interactions, such as search, form inputs, or multi-step flows.

---

### 3. Dialogs Are Designed for Interruptions, Not Fluid UI

Dialogs are designed to demand immediate attention by blocking interaction with the background.

* On desktop, this behavior is generally acceptable due to larger screen sizes and multiple focus areas.
* However, on mobile, a dialog obstructs the entire screen, which can feel jarring and disrupt the user's flow.

<Callout title="But isn't that interruptive behavior sometimes necessary?">  
Yes, it is. For example, when a user action will result in deleting an item, a dialog is appropriate to confirm the action and prevent accidental data loss.

Native Modal can handle these specific use-cases using `alert` and `defaultModal` props.
</Callout>


With a **drawer**, the experience stays **smooth**â€”users can:  

* Scroll naturally
* Keep their context
* Maintain a sense of control

---

### 4. Drawers Are Better for Complex User Flows

Both **Apple** and **Google** discourage the use of dialogs for complex interactions.

* When a modal requires multi-step input (e.g., a form), a drawer provides a more natural interaction.
* Drawers facilitate progressive disclosure without creating a sense of an "app within an app."

### 5. Studies Indicate Drawers Can Improve User Experience

Research on modal vs. drawer usability supports the use of drawers in many mobile contexts:

## Conclusion: Why Native Modal Matters

Instead of requiring developers to choose between modals and drawers, `native-modal` automatically selects the optimal UX based on screen size.

* Zero additional setup is required.
* It delivers an enhanced mobile UX by mitigating modal-related frustrations.
* It aligns with native OS design patterns, resulting in a more intuitive feel.

### Give it a tryâ€”your users will appreciate it!

```tsx
export const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <NativeModal>
      <NativeModalTrigger>Open</NativeModalTrigger>
      <NativeModalContent>
        <div className="p-4 bg-background">Hello from Native Modal!</div>
      </NativeModalContent>
    </NativeModal>
  )
}
```
