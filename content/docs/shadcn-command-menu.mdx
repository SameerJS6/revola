## Overview


The Shadcn Command Menu is a searchable command palette that helps users quickly navigate your documentation built with [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/).

This version is adapted from the original [shadcn/ui Command Menu](https://ui.shadcn.com/), with a few enhancements and tighter integration with Revola for responsive behavior and improved reliability.

<ComponentDetails name="shadcn-command-menu" />

## Installation

```package-install
npx shadcn@latest add https://revola.sameerjs.com/r/shadcn-command-menu.json
```

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step>
#### Basic Implementation

Import the component and supporting utilities from your local files:

```tsx
import ShadcnCommandMenu from "@/components/shadcn-command-menu";
import { getColors } from "@/lib/colors";
import { source } from "@/lib/source";
```
</Step>

<Step>
#### Create the Menu Component

Since `pageTree` is a server-side value, retrieve it and pass it (along with the color palette) to the component in a client-safe wrapper.

```tsx title="components/command-menu-wrapper.tsx"
import ShadcnCommandMenu from "@/components/ui/shadcn-command-menu";
import { getColors } from "@/lib/colors";
import { source } from "@/lib/source";

export default function CommandMenuWrapper() {
  const colors = getColors();
  const pageTree = source.pageTree;

  return (
    <div className="space-x-4 space-y-4">
      <ShadcnCommandMenu tree={pageTree} colors={colors} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
#### Add to Your Layout

Include the command menu in your layout or navigation:

```tsx title="components/navigation.tsx"
import CommandMenuWrapper from "@/components/command-menu-wrapper";

export function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav className="flex items-center gap-4">
      <CommandMenuWrapper />
      {/* Other navigation items */}
    </nav>
  );
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
You're all set!
Enjoy the enhanced command menu experience.

## Note

Thereâ€™s a known issue: if a valid search result is found, everything works correctly (including showing the secondary action).

![This will be fixed soon](/shadcn-command-menu-issue.png)


However, if you change the search query to something that doesn't match any item, the secondary action still appears, even though it shouldn't.
