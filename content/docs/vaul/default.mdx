### Side drawer

Revola supports Vaul's directional drawer system. Set the `direction` prop to `"right"` or `"left"` to change the drawer position. Use the `--initial-transform` CSS variable to adjust animations when the drawer doesn't touch the screen edge.

### Scrollable

Revola inherits Vaul's scrollable content handling for long content within drawers.

### Controlled

Revola supports Vaul's controlled state management. Use the `open` prop to programmatically control the drawer state, and `onOpenChange` to respond to user interactions like escape key presses or outside clicks.
