<ComponentPreview name="default-demo" />

### Side drawer

Set the direction prop to `"right"` or `"left"` to change the position of the drawer. Use the `--initial-transform` CSS variable to adjust the animation, useful when the drawer does not touch the edge of the screen (like in this case).

### Scrollable

A scrollable Revola.

<ComponentPreview name="scrollable-demo" />

### Controlled

You can use the `open` prop to programmatically open or close the drawer. You can also pass the `onOpenChange` prop which will be called when the open state of the Revola changes, it's useful if you want to react to esc/outside clicks when controlled.
