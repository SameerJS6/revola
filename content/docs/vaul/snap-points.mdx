Revola inherits Vaul's powerful snap points system - a way to define specific points that the drawer can snap to during drag operations. This means drawers can be partially open, not just fully open or closed. You can combine this with responsive classes like `sm:overflow-y-auto` to handle desktop scrolling behavior when needed.

### Interact with background

Combine Vaul's `modal={false}` with snap points to enable background interaction while Revola is partially open.

### Snap to sequential points

Revola supports Vaul's sequential snapping control. Use `snapToSequentialPoint` to disable velocity-based snapping, ensuring no snap points are skipped regardless of gesture speed. Useful when each snap point is equally important.

### Custom fade index

Revola inherits Vaul's fade customization system. Use `fadeFromIndex` to specify which snap point should begin the fade effect. While it defaults to the last point, you can customize it for different visual effects.
