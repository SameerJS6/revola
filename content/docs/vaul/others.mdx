### Alert Dialog

Revola supports alert dialog functionality for critical user interactions that require acknowledgment. When `alert={true}` is set, the dialog prevents background interaction (clicking outside or pressing overlay) while still allowing users to close via:

- ESC key press
- Close button interaction
- Swipe-to-close gesture (on mobile)

This is ideal for confirmations, warnings, or any content that requires user attention before proceeding.

You can use this to replace traditional alert dialogs. Combine `alert={true}` and `onlyDialog={true}` to get proper alert dialog component behavior, which will render a dialog on all screen sizes instead of being responsive.

### Non-modal

By default, Revola blocks background interaction when open. Revola inherits Vaul's non-modal capability - set `modal={false}` to allow users to interact with the page behind Revola.

### Non-dismissible

Revola supports Vaul's dismissible control system. Set `dismissible={false}` to prevent typical closure methods (clicking outside, escape key, swiping down). Useful for critical interactions that require explicit confirmation.
