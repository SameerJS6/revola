### Non-modal
By default, Revola blocks background interaction when open. Revola inherits Vaul's non-modal capability - set `modal={false}` to allow users to interact with the page behind Revola.

### Non-dismissible
Revola supports Vaul's dismissible control system. Set `dismissible={false}` to prevent typical closure methods (clicking outside, escape key, swiping down). Useful for critical interactions that require explicit confirmation.
