### Non-modal
Set the `modal` prop to `false` to allow interaction with the background while the drawer is open.

<ComponentPreview name="other-default-demo" mobilePreviewLink="/vaul/other" />

### Non-dismissible
Set the `dismissible` prop to `false` to prevent the user from closing the drawer by clicking outside of it, pressing the escape key, or dragging it down. Don't open this one or else you'll have to refresh the page to close it.

<ComponentPreview name="non-dismissible-default-demo" mobilePreviewLink="/vaul/other/non-dismissible" />
