## Installation

Native Modal is built using:  
- **[Radix UI Dialog](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog)** for modals on larger screens.  
- **[Vaul](https://vaul.emilkowal.ski/)** for drawers on mobile devices.  

While it does **not require shadcn**, it integrates seamlessly with shadcn's styling and uses its CLI for quick installation.  

### Install via Shadcn CLI 

If you already have **shadcn** installed in your project, you can install **Native Modal** with:  

```bash title="Install native-modal"
pnpm dlx shadcn add native-modal
```

<Callout>
Note: If you havenâ€™t set up shadcn, you can install it first: 
```bash title="terminal"
pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init
```
</Callout>


### Manual Installation (Without Shadcn)
If you prefer not to use shadcn, you can install the required dependencies manually:

```bash
pnpm add @radix-ui/react-dialog vaul
```

Then, copy the `native-modal.tsx` component into your project manually.


## Create a Native Modal Component

Once installed, you can use Native Modal anywhere in your app:

```tsx 
import { 
  NativeModal, 
  NativeModalTrigger, 
  NativeModalContent, 
  NativeModalHeader, 
  NativeModalTitle, 
  NativeModalDescription 
  } from "@/components/ui/native-modal";
```

```tsx

export default function Demo() {
  return (
    <NativeModal>
      <NativeModalTrigger>Open Native Modal</NativeModalTrigger>
      <NativeModalContent>
        <div className="bg-background p-4">
          <NativeModalHeader>
            <NativeModalTitle>Welcome</NativeModalTitle>
            <NativeModalDescription>
              This is a responsive modal that adapts between drawer & modal.
            </NativeModalDescription>
          </NativeModalHeader>
        </div>
      </NativeModalContent> 
    </NativeModal> 
  );
}
```
