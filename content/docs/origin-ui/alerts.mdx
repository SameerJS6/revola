Revola supports alert dialog behavior using the `alert` prop. Pair it with
`onlyDialog` for consistent dialog rendering across all devices, or use `alert`
alone for responsive behavior (drawer on mobile, dialog on desktop).

Even in responsive mode, alert semantics are preserved: no background dismissal,
no default close button, but drag-to-close remains available.

### Alert Dialog

A basic alert dialog using `alert` and `onlyDialog` that renders consistently as
a dialog on all devices. Perfect for simple confirmations that need the same UX
everywhere.

### Alert Dialog with Icon
