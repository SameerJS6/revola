Origin UI is a collection of beautiful, real-world components. We've ported their dialog examples to use Revola instead of Shadcn's Dialog, demonstrating how effortlessly you can adapt Revola to existing components. 

These examples showcase practical scenarios you encounter daily—authentication flows, payment processing, user feedback, confirmations, and informational content.
