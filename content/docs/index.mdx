## Overview

**Revola** automatically adapts to screen size — it acts like a drawer on mobile to stay out of the way, and turns into a classic modal on larger screens (`640px` and above) when you need to grab the user's attention.

It’s designed as a drop-in, better replacement for the default Dialog component — with built-in mobile support and no extra hassle.

### How It Works?

Revola is built on top of:

- [Radix UI Dialog](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog) — for the modal/dialog experience.
- [Vaul](https://vaul.emilkowal.ski/) — for the mobile drawer behavior.

It also uses **shadcn/ui** CSS variables for styling — but it doesn't require shadcn itself.
