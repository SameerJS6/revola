## Overview

Its a responsive modal component that adapts to different screen sizes. On mobile devices, it behaves as a drawer, ensuring a non-intrusive experience. 

While on larger screens (`640px` and above), it functions as a dialog/modal to draw user attention effectively. This adaptive behavior enhances usability without requiring extra effort from developers.

### How It Works?  
Native Modal is built on top of:  
- **[Radix UI Dialog](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog)** for dialog/modal.  
- **[Vaul](https://vaul.emilkowal.ski/)** for drawer.  

It also uses shadcnâ€™s CSS variables for styling but does **not** strictly depend on shadcn itself.  

{/* ### Features 
- **Zero-config:** Works out of the box.  
- **Fully responsive:** Auto-switches between drawer & modal.  
- **Accessible:** Keyboard navigation & focus management.   */}
